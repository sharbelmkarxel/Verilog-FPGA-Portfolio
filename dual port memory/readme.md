This project implements a dual-port RAM system in Verilog, supporting simultaneous and independent memory access on two ports. Each port operates with its own address, data lines, and read/write controls, allowing parallel access to the memory block without contention under normal operation. This architecture is crucial in systems where concurrent memory operations are required, such as in register files or multi-core communication environments. The module resolves address collisions and synchronizes access based on clock inputs. Parameterization enables easy configuration of memory size and data width.
