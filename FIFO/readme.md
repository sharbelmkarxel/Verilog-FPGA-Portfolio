This project implements a synchronous First-In First-Out (FIFO) memory buffer using Verilog. The FIFO design allows data to be written and read sequentially, preserving the order in which it arrives. Internally, it uses pointer-based indexing to manage data storage and wrap-around logic to simulate a circular buffer. It features synchronous read and write operations on the same clock edge, with full and empty flag indicators to monitor buffer status.

ModelSim simulations validate the design's behavior, and waveform captures are included to visually demonstrate the FIFOâ€™s internal state transitions during operation.
