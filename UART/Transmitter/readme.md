This UART Transmitter module provides the transmission half of a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter protocol using Verilog. Designed for serial communication, it accepts parallel 8-bit input data and converts it into a serial bitstream following the standard UART format: one start bit, eight data bits, and one stop bit. The module includes a baud rate generator that divides the system clock to match the desired communication speed, ensuring correct timing of transmitted bits. A finite state machine governs the transmission process, managing transitions through idle, start, data, and stop states. It also features status indicators for busy and ready signals to interface with upstream modules
