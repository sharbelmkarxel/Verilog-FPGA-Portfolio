# Verilog-FPGA-Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, I showcase my digital design skills using Verilog and other hardware description languages (HDLs). This portfolio includes a variety of modules, systems, and testbenches, demonstrating my ability to design, simulate, and verify digital hardware.

## üöÄ Projects

Each project folder includes:
- `src/` ‚Äì Source Verilog/HDL files
- `tb/` ‚Äì Testbenches to simulate and verify the modules
- `README.md` ‚Äì Project-specific details, features, instructions, and results

Example projects include:
- Flip-Flops, Counters, and basic modules
- FSM designs
- Communication interfaces (UART, SPI, etc.)
- Mini-processor or ALU
- Custom digital systems

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- Digital design using Verilog and HDLs
- Writing testbenches for simulation and verification
- Using simulators (ModelSim)
- Creating documentation and diagrams
